LUUR (pronounced /loÕùor/) is a cross-distro package manager for Linux. Its goal is to provide developers and maintainers with an easy-to-use, unified, repository to compile their packages for. It does this by providing adapters for popular distro-specific package managers (e.g. apt, pacman) and managing the building of packages in a way tailored to each distro's nuances.

LUUR packages work in a way inspired by repositories such as [NixPkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/). All package metadata is kept in a single git [repository](https://github.com/project-luur/luur), and package updates are made through pull requests. By default, LUUR looks for the most up to date packages from the unstable channel. Alternatively, users are able to choose a stable release (every six months) which recieve security backports, or specify package versions by giving LUUR a specific commit.
